#  Kata Containers image

This directory contains the sources to update rpm specfiles anddebian source

With these files we generated Fedora and Ubuntu packages for this component.

``./update_image.sh [VERSION]``

This script will generate and update sources to create

  * clear-containers-image_XXXX-XX.dsc
  * clear-containers-image.spec

By default, the script will get VERSION specified in the ``versions.txt`` file

To push your changes and trigger a new build of the runtime to the OBS repo,

``update_image.sh`` as follows:
